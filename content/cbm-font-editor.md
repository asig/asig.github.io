A little tool that allows you to modify fonts for a wide range of Commodore home computers, and to store your creations as binary files (in plain and 'prg' format), as BASIC programs or as source code for the cbmasm cross-assembler. You can also see it in action live [here](https://cbmfonteditor.com).
