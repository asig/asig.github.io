Ever wanted to add a nice looking table to your text file that uses those fancy old-school DOS-style borders? Then termdraw is for you!

It allows you to simply draw such borders in any text file by just moving your cursor around. It supports single, double, and heavy borders, and also correcty handles crossing!

Besides that, you can also just edit text :-)
